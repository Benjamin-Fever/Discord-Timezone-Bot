  <h1>Timezone Bot</h1>
  <p>This is a simple timezone bot that displays two different timezones, NZ and USA. 
    This was created because my friends on my discord server are from different timezones, this allows us to easily keep track during conversations in chat when planning things together. Below is an example of what it looks like in action</p>
